I'm a Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I write technical articles pertaining to the Django Python framework and web
development. My most recent article published in DigitalOcean Tutorials is on
security hardening Django projects. I am currently working on open-source
Electron-based desktop applications and Typescript-based PWAs right here on GitHub!
