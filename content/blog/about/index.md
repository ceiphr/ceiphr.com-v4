My name is Ari. I am a twenty-something studying Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I write technical articles. Not frequently, but I do. When I'm too busy not writing anything for this
site, [I sometimes write for DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/ceiphr). They pay well.
Right now, I'm a technical writing intern for [Eastech Flow Controls](https://www.smartwastewater.com/). But, that's
just for the summer.

I don't really make that many Django projects anymore, but that's all I really write about since I enjoy Python so much. 
For the most part, everything I work on right now is using React. Fuck Facebook, but Reactâ€¦ React is nice. 

[whereismaurice.com](https://whereismaurice.com) is one of my latest React projects. It's doing
pretty well (20k views a month).

## This Site

My website is really intended for writing, but I might put some other stuff on here. I don't really know yet.
Regardless, let's discuss the technical aspects of this site.

It's a Gatsby site. Hosted on Vercel ([ceiphr.vercel.app](https://ceiphr.vercel.app/)). Tailwind CSS styles
_almost_ the entire site. There are those edge cases where it's inconvenient/clunky to use.

Of course, I'm using TypeScript. I'm not a JavaScript masochist.

## Contact

You can contact me at [ari@ceiphr.com](mailto:ari@ceiphr.com). I'm quick to respond. Except on finals' week.

I don't really like speaking or collaborative writing, so don't contact me about that stuff.

If I fucked up something in an article, either email me or comment on the post. Either way, I won't fix it.

Just kidding, I will.

_P.S. If you think I should go to prison for crimes again
humanity, [here is my mugshot (double chin, included)](/ari-birnbaum.png)._
